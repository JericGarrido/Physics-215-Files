    "In Section 2.8 we analyzed the performance of ``reachable_nodes`` and classified it as $O(n+m)$, where $n$ is the number of nodes and $m$ is the number of edges. Continuing the analysis, what is the order of growth for ``is_connected``?\n",

    "Note that defining the function and writing the initial element of a list is constant in time. So the first two lines of the code are constant in time. Calling the ``reachable_nodes`` is also constant in time, but as shown is Section 2.8, the ``reachable_nodes`` function is of the order $O(n+m)$. Finally, as said in ThinkPython 2nd Ed., then ``len(G)`` operation is also constant in time (It was said that ``len`` is one of the exceptions, for most string and tuple operations are constant in time). Hence, the ``is_connected(G)`` function runs to the order $O(n+m)$."
